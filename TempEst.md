# Inspecting the temporality of sequences using TempEst

Before

The data we will be using in this exercise are:

- [**TB_cluster_ML.tree**](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1FRyfCeEqqIPoRLB81JJYyBomqORJG7fS) – A Maximum Likelihood phylogeny from 37 _M. tuberculosis_ samples collected between 2005 - 2014 in British Columbia. This is an untimed phylogeny so the branches will be in units of substitutions/site.

- [**TB_cluster.txt**](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1kR8uE2pmGGBsH5UbxPdhvnkQJNPLe78I) – A text file with two columns, the name of the 37 _M. tuberculosis_ samples and their collection dates.
